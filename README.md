## Background

- - -

I was recently hired on by `New York Citi Bike Program,` the largest bike sharing program in the United States, as the new lead analyst to assist in generating regular reports for city officials. Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data of the program's utilization infrastructure. Because city officials are looking to publicize and improve the city program, the following `CITY BIKE ANALYTICS CASE REPORT` was created to share Citi Bike's program utilization via monthly collected data from January 2020 to June 2020. 

##### Note: This Report was written/edited with Tableau Public, Python, Pandas, and Microsoft Excel.
